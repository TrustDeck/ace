TrustDeck provides a robust solution for pseudonymization and identity management and features high scalability and an integrated audit trail. Its architecture enables the creation of domain hierarchies with inheritable properties that provide both configuration and customization capabilities. The service allows for defining entities via type definition to maximize customizability. Complemented by a modern REST interface and state-of-the-art web technologies, TrustDeck is well suited for the use by trusted third party personnel as well as integration into data processing pipelines. It is built with Java and SpringBoot, the service integrates with Keycloak for authentication, HikariCP for efficient database connection pooling, jOOQ for type-safe SQL query construction, and PostgreSQL as the backend database.
